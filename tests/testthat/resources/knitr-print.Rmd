```{r}
bt <- reticulate::import_builtins()
bt$print("Hello world")
```

Both in `jupyter_compat = TRUE` and `jupyter_compat = FALSE` we should see the
results, because a `print` was called:

```{python}
print(1)
print(2)
```

```{python, jupyter_compat = TRUE}
print(1)
print(2)
```

For the `jupyter_compat = FALSE` mode we should see the output of both expressions.
In `jupyter_compat`, we should only see the output for the last expression. 

```{python}
1 + 0
1 + 1
```

```{python, jupyter_compat = TRUE}
1 + 0
1 + 1
```
