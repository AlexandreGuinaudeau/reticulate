```{python}
y = [2, 4, 6]

# Comment about len
print(len(y))

# Comment about type is attached to the code above (unlike R). It should be with the code below.
print(type(y))

```

```{python, collapse=TRUE}
# Same Example with Collapsed Chunk
y = [2, 4, 6]

# Note the output of this command is not available immediately below it (unlike R).
print(len(y))

# Comment about type is attached to the code above (unlike R). It should be with the code below.
# The output of previous command is printed after this comment (unlike R).
print(type(y))

```

```{r}
# Comparative Code for R    
x = c(2, 4, 6)

# Output of length() is given just after the command (as expected)
print(length(x))

# Comment about class is attached to the code below (as expected)
print(class(x))
```


```{r, collapse=TRUE}
# Comparative Code for R    
x = c(2, 4, 6)

# Output of length() is given just after the command (as expected)
print(length(x))

# Comment about class is attached to the code below (as expected)
print(class(x))
